# 8-Queens-and-Genetic-Algorithm
This project provide illustration and implementation for the 8- queens problem in python language.
uploaded files are:
1. defFor8queens that are used to implemet the functions of the genetic algorithms and combining the in 8 queens function that is used in testing.
2. 8Queens is where the testing of the implemented code occurred.
3. Genetic Alorithm For Optimization is a pdf file that illustrates the methods used to construct the genetic algorithm.
4.Applying the Genetic Algorithm to the 8 queens Problem where the combination of all implemented functions of the genetic algorithm in one function (used in 8 queens testing) occurred.
